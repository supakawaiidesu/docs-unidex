## Introduction
Using Instant swap you can scan between 13 different aggregators and meta-aggregators to fill your order. The user pays for the gas, approving each aggregator, and generally gets exactly what they see assuming negative price movement.

#### Methodology
Instant swap provides a similar user experience to existing swap apps. Simply quote a trade, it gets priced against the entire ecosystem, and your swap will fill at the best rate that the network can offer.
