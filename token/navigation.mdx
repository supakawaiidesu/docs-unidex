## Overview
The MOLTEN token (address: `0x66E535e8D2ebf13F49F3D49e5c50395a97C137b1`) is a LayerZero OFT token that serves multiple purposes within the UniDex ecosystem. While the token belongs to UniDex, it has been rebranded to Molten to align with its vision and scaling solution. The token is available across multiple chains including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and Optimism.

## Core Functions

### Protocol Fee Distribution
The MOLTEN token plays a crucial role in the protocol's economic model through fee distribution:

- **20%** of all protocol fees (from trades and liquidations) are used to buyback and burn MOLTEN tokens, reducing the circulating supply (this happens from the address `0x8c128f336B479b142429a5f351Af225457a987Fa` which is managed by external keepers to handle the buyback logic, and the team manually burns the tokens)
- **15%** of fees are distributed to MOLTEN stakers
- Fees are collected from all chains and products within the ecosystem

### Native Gas Token
MOLTEN serves as the native gas token for the Molten Network, leveraging its synergistic relationship with the Molten Network team. This integration strengthens the token's utility within the broader ecosystem.

## Staking Mechanics

### How to Stake
- Staking is exclusively available on Arbitrum
- Visit [leverage.unidex.exchange/staking](https://leverage.unidex.exchange/staking) to stake your MOLTEN tokens
- Staking is single-sided, eliminating any impermanent loss risk

### Staking Benefits
- Earn a portion of trading fees from all platform activity
- Receive up to 15% of protocol fees, paid in MOLTEN tokens
- Fees from all chains are automatically:
  1. Collected from various chains
  2. Converted to MOLTEN
  3. Distributed to stakers through relayers

### Cross-Chain Compatibility
The MOLTEN token maintains the same address across all supported networks:
- Ethereum
- Arbitrum
- Base
- Optimism

This cross-chain presence is enabled by LayerZero's OFT (Omnichain Fungible Token) technology, allowing seamless movement of tokens between networks.
