# Referral Program

Welcome to UniDex's Referral Program! This program allows you to earn rewards by referring traders to our platform. Here's everything you need to know about our referral system.

## Getting Started

To participate in our referral program, follow these simple steps:

1. Visit [https://leverage.unidex.exchange/referrals](https://leverage.unidex.exchange/referrals)
2. Click the "Create" button
3. Enter your custom referral code (case sensitive)
4. Click "Submit Code" and sign the transaction

Once completed, your code will be registered on-chain with our v4 trading contracts.

## Important Notes

- Referral codes are assigned on a first-come, first-served basis.
- Our admin address can overwrite codes in case of impersonation or code theft.
- You cannot use your own referral code when trading to prevent self-discounts and rebates.

## Rewards Structure

Our referral program features a tiered reward system based on three factors:
1. Weekly Referred Volume
2. MOLTEN Staking
3. USD.m Holdings

The base discount and rebate start at 2.5% for both referrers and traders, with the potential to increase up to 20% based on your tier in each category.
