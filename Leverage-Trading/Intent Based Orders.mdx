## Introduction

The UniDexV4 margin system is an innovative, smart contract-based solution designed to support multiple stablecoins and facilitate cross-chain deposits. This document outlines the key features and processes of the margin system.

## How It Works

It's important to note that the UniDexV4 margin system doesn't create a separate wallet for users. Instead, it utilizes an internal smart contract to track and manage user balances. When you deposit funds into the UniDex vault, the protocol credits your account with the corresponding USD balance, which you can then use for trading.

## Supported Assets

UniDexV4 supports a variety of stablecoins, offering users flexibility in their choice of collateral. Currently supported assets include:

- USDT
- USDC
- DAI
- sUSDe

This multi-asset support allows users to interact with the platform using their preferred stablecoin, enhancing accessibility and reducing the need for additional token swaps.

## Deposit & Withdraw

### The Vault

The UniDexV4 vault contract is designed to accommodate multiple stablecoin assets. By depositing funds into the vault, users receive a credited USD balance on the platform, which can be used for trading and later redeemed for any of the supported underlying deposits.

UniDexV4 leverages meta-aggregators like Li.fi to enable cross-chain deposits. This feature allows users to deposit assets from various blockchain networks, streamlining the onboarding process and keeping things on just 1 network.

### Withdrawals

Withdrawals from the UniDexV4 system are straightforward:
1. Select the stablecoin you wish to withdraw
2. Enter the withdrawal amount
3. Confirm the transaction

<Note>
  User balances are tracked within the smart contract. In the event of any front-end issues, manual withdrawals are always possible through direct interaction with the smart contract.

## Security and Transparency

The UniDexV4 margin system prioritizes security and transparency:

- **Smart Contract-Based**: All balances and transactions are managed by secure, audited smart contracts.
- **No Custodial Wallets**: The system doesn't create or manage separate wallets, reducing potential points of failure.

## Conclusion

The UniDexV4 margin system offers a flexible, secure, and user-centric approach to managing collateral on the platform. By supporting multiple stablecoins and enabling cross-chain deposits, all managed through an internal smart contract, UniDexV4 aims to provide a seamless and efficient trading experience for users across different blockchain ecosystems.
