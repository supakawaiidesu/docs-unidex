## Overview

The Trading Account is a smart contract wallet (similar to Safeâ„¢) that serves as your personal gateway for cross-chain perpetual trading. It's automatically generated when you first interact with our platform and becomes your primary interface for all trading activities.

## How It Works

### Smart Wallet Generation
1. Connect your regular wallet to our platform
2. Sign a message to generate your unique Trading Account
3. Your Trading Account is now ready to accept deposits and execute trades

### Key Features
- **Multi-Chain Deposits**: Accept funds from any supported blockchain
- **Cross-Chain Execution**: Place orders on multiple chains simultaneously
- **Non-Custodial**: Maintain full control of your funds at all times
- **Zero Latency**: Execute trades simultaneously across different protocols
- **One Click Trading**: CEX style trading with no manual confirmations required
- **Batching**: Up to 10 individual transactions can be bundled into a single one allowing things like approvals, deposits, and trades to be executed in a single transaction.

### Step 2: Generate Trading Account
After connecting your wallet, look for the "establish connection" prompt. The simplest way to generate your trading account is through the deposit/withdraw button. Sign the message when prompted, and the page will refresh automatically once setup is complete.
