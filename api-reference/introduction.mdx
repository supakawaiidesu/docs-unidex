## Welcome to UniDex API

The UniDex Trading API provides programmatic access to UniDex's trading functionality, allowing you to integrate our advanced trading features into your applications.

## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:
```bash
https://unidexv4-api-production.up.railway.app
```

## Authentication

Currently, our public endpoints don't require authentication. However, you'll need to provide Ethereum addresses for user-specific operations.

## Request Format

- For GET requests, parameters should be sent as query parameters
- For POST requests, parameters should be sent in the request body as JSON
- All addresses should be in standard Ethereum format (0x...)

## Common Parameters

Many endpoints accept these common parameters:
- `address`: Ethereum address of the user
- `assetId`: Trading pair identifier (e.g., 1 for BTC/USD)

<Note>
  Looking to build custom integrations? We offer grants for developers! Contact us through our Discord.
