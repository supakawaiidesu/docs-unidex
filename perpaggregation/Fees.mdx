## How does UniDex charge fees?

`There are no fees charged by UniDex for aggregated trades` 

There are fees charged by the underlying protocols however. For example, GMXv1 charges a 0.1% fee on every trade. UniDex does not charge any additional fees on top of this. However, UniDex does pass a referral address to collect a rebate from each aggregated order.

This lets UniDex traders both save on fees and earn a rebate on every trade by using UniDex. The rebate is currently variable based on the protocol and the size of the trade and the overall volume of our protocol.
