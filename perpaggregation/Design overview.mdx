## 1st Perp Aggregator

One of the key unique features of our protocol is aggregation. Since 2021, we've been aggregating external perp protocols like XVIX, Gambit, Perpetual protocol, and GMX.
Since then we've expanded our aggregation to include more protocols like MUX, GMX Forks, and GMXv2.

## How It Works

Our protocol enables seamless access to multiple perpetual exchanges through a unique smart wallet system called "Trading Account". Here's how it works:

### Trading Account
The Trading Account is a smart contract wallet (similar to Safeâ„¢) that serves as your gateway to cross-chain perpetual trading. This innovative approach allows you to:
- Deposit funds from any supported chain
- Execute trades across multiple chains simultaneously
- Access various perpetual DEXs without chain-switching friction

### User Flow
1. Visit the platform
2. Connect your wallet
3. Sign a message to generate your Trading Account
4. Fund your Trading Account from any supported chain
5. Start trading on any supported perpetual DEX across any supported chain

### Key Benefits
- **Cross-chain Trading**: Place orders on multiple chains without switching networks
- **Zero Latency**: Execute trades simultaneously across different protocols
- **Unified Liquidity**: Access deep liquidity pools from various perpetual DEXs
- **Simplified Experience**: Manage all your positions through a single interface
